# goog-modules-example-basic
A simple, very basic example of dynamically loading javascript files into a 
single page web applicaiton, this was meant for a specific developer to checkout, but 
made public in the hope that it will help someone get over the basics.


plovr is provided with the thingy, and needs to be run before this thing can be used.
